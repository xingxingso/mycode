What Are Articles? (with Examples)
The articles are a, an, and the. Articles are words that define whether something is specific or unspecific. For example:

Use 'the' to define something as specific:
This is the lake.
(This is a previously specified lake, i.e., one already known to the audience.)
Use 'a' or 'an' to define something as unspecific:
This is a lake.
(This is a previously unspecified lake.)
Even though there are three articles (the, a, an), there are two types of articles:
The Definite Article (the)
The Indefinite Article (a and an).
The is called the definite article because it is used to indicate something specific. A and An are called the indefinite articles because they are used to indicate something unspecific.

Of note, the articles are classified as determiners, which are type of adjective.
Examples of the Definite and Indefinite Articles
Here are some examples of the articles in use:
I fell over the chair again.
(The chair is specific. It is known to the audience.)
Can you pass me a chair?
(This means an unspecific chair, i.e., any chair.)
I loved the apple pie after the meal.
(In this example, the audience knows which apple pie is being praised, e.g., the one at last night's dinner.)
I love an apple pie after dinner.
(The audience understands that the speaker likes to eat an apple pie after dinner (any apple pie will do).) 

I'm not a troublemaker. I'm the troublemaker!
(This means "I'm not any old troublemaker. I'm the one you all know about.")
